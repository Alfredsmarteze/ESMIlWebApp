                 miraculously, the break-through was financial break-through. Not just that alone my GP has been awesome, 
                 when I calculated it I was like oh my God, this is your hands in my academics. What a miracle working God.
                 Truely scripture is true- "Those that put their trust in God, their face will never be put to shame."
